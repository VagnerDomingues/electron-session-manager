# Electron PWA Boilerplate

A versatile Electron boilerplate for converting any Progressive Web App (PWA) or website into a native desktop application. Features comprehensive environment-based configuration and comes with pre-configured examples for popular web applications.

<!-- ![Build Status](https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/workflows/Build%20Electron%20App/badge.svg) -->

## üöÄ Why This Project Exists

This project was born from two main motivations:

### üéØ Learning Electron & Blockchain Integration
I've always wanted to dive deep into Electron and explore its capabilities, particularly for integrating **blockchain wallets into native applications**. This boilerplate serves as my foundation for understanding Electron's architecture and as a stepping stone toward more advanced projects involving Web3 and cryptocurrency wallet integrations.

### üíª Solving macOS PWA Limitations
The immediate trigger for this project came from my transition to **macOS**, which is happening slowly. I was frustrated with how browser-installed PWAs behave differently from native applications:

- **The Problem**: When you install PWAs through the browser (using "Add to Dock" or similar features), they completely **close** when you click the 'X' button
- **Native App Behavior**: Real macOS applications minimize to the background and stay in the dock when you close their window
- **My Specific Need**: I rely heavily on **Asana** and **WhatsApp Web**, and I don't like to use the distributed **WhatsApp** native desktop app for a few reasons. So throughout my workday, constantly having to reopen them was breaking my workflow

This Electron wrapper gives web applications the same **minimize-to-background behavior** as native macOS apps, solving my productivity issue while providing a solid foundation for future Electron development.

- **An unwanted Bonus Feature**: The context isolation that Electron provides also enables you to have **multiple instances of WhatsApp** running simultaneously in different contexts. This means you can have one dedicated application for WhatsApp Business while keeping your personal WhatsApp Web in another instance within the same app.

 whatsapp instances if you manage support for multiple companies - which is a really cool feature that was unintended and makes it useful for managing multiple accounts!


## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è Convert any web application to a native desktop app
- üîí Browsing with context isolation
- üîî Native notifications support
- üåç Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚ú® Custom user agent support for compatibility with known apps such as **Whatsapp web**
- üöÄ GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated builds
- üì¶ Multiple build targets (installers, portable, etc.)
- üçé **True native macOS behavior** - apps minimize instead of closing
- üì± **Multiple app instances** - Run separate instances of the same web app with different contexts/accounts connected

## üìã Available Example Configurations

This boilerplate comes with 5 pre-configured examples ready to use:

| App | Configuration File | URL | Features |
|-----|-------------------|-----|----------|
| üîß **Generic PWA** | `.env.example` | `https://example.com` | Template for any web app |
| üí¨ **WhatsApp Web** | `configs/whatsappweb.env` | `https://web.whatsapp.com` | Chrome user agent, multiple instances |
| üéÆ **Discord** | `configs/discord.env` | `https://discord.com/app` | Gaming communication platform |
| üìù **Notion** | `configs/notion.env` | `https://www.notion.so` | Workspace and notes |
| üì± **Asana** | `configs/asana.env` | `https://app.asana.com` | Project management |
| ü§ñ **ChatGPT** | `configs/chatgpt.env` | `https://chat.openai.com` | AI assistant |

### üì± Rewrite examples configurations for Other PWAs or your own web page

You can easily adapt this for:

- **Telegram**: `https://web.telegram.org`
- **Gmail**: `https://mail.google.com`
- **Notion**: `https://www.notion.so`
- **Figma**: `https://www.figma.com`
- **And any other website or PWA with one limitation\***

\* as long as the login form don't redirect to an external page it won't open system default browser and it will work flawless.

```

### Building

### Single App Build

Build your currently configured app for the current platform:
```bash
npm run build
```

Build for specific platforms:
```bash
npm run build:win     # Windows
npm run build:mac     # macOS  
npm run build:linux   # Linux
```

Build with specific installers:
```bash
npm run build:win:nsis      # Windows NSIS installer
npm run build:win:portable  # Windows portable
npm run build:mac:dmg       # macOS DMG
```

Build for all platforms at once:
```bash
npm run build:all
```

### Build All Examples at Once

This boilerplate includes a powerful feature to automatically build **all** example PWAs in one command:

#### Build All Examples for Windows
```bash
npm run build:examples:win
```

#### Build All Examples for macOS
```bash
npm run build:examples:mac
```

#### Build All Examples for Linux
```bash
npm run build:examples:linux
```

#### Build All Examples for All Platforms
```bash
npm run build:examples:all
```

This will:
1. üíæ Backup your current `.env` file to `temp.env`
2. üîÑ Loop through each example configuration:
   - Asana
   - ChatGPT  
   - Discord
   - Notion
   - WhatsApp Web
3. üì¶ Build each app into its own folder: `dist/appname/`
4. üîÑ Restore your original `.env` file

#### Example Output Structure
```
dist/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asana/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ asana.exe (or .app)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatgpt/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chatgpt.exe (or .app)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discord/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ discord.exe (or .app)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notion/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notion.exe (or .app)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ whatsappweb/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ whatsappweb.exe (or .app)
```

The built applications will be available in the `dist` folder, organized by app name.

### GitHub Actions Integration

This boilerplate includes GitHub Actions workflows that will:

1. **On every push**: Build and test all examples
2. **On tag creation** (e.g., `v1.0.0`): 
   - Build all examples for Windows and macOS
   - Create a GitHub Release with downloadable archives
   - Include all example apps ready for distribution

#### Creating a Release

To create a release with all examples:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger GitHub Actions to:
- Build all 5 PWA examples
- Package them for Windows (`.zip`) and macOS (`.tar.gz`)
- Create a GitHub Release with download links
- Include installation instructions for each platform


## Security Features

- Context isolation enabled
- Node integration disabled
- Remote module disabled
- External links open in default browser
- Navigation restricted to configured app domain
- Clean interface without application menu

## Customization

### Icons

The boilerplate includes icons for popular applications in the `assets/Appicons/` folder:
- `Discord.ico/.png` - Discord desktop app
- `WhatsApp.ico/.png` - WhatsApp Web  
- `Notion.ico/.png` - Notion workspace
- `ChatGPT.ico/.png` - ChatGPT interface
- `Asana.ico/.png` - Asana project management

To add your own icons, place them in `assets/Appicons/` and update your `.env` file:
```env
WIN_ICON=assets/Appicons/YourApp.ico
MAC_ICON=assets/Appicons/YourApp.png
```

### App Information

The boilerplate uses environment variables for configuration, so you typically don't need to edit everything in `package.json` directly. Instead:

1. **For runtime configuration** - Use your `.env` file:
   ```env
   APP_NAME=Your App Name
   APP_URL=https://your-app.com
   WINDOW_TITLE=Your App
   ```

2. **For build-time configuration** - The build script automatically uses environment variables to customize the final package

3. **For permanent changes** - Edit `package.json` if needed:
   - `name` - App package name
   - `productName` - Display name
   - `author` - Your name
   - `description` - App description
- `appId` - Unique app identifier in build config

## Build Configuration

The app uses `electron-builder` for packaging. Configuration is in the `build` section of `package.json`.

### Windows Build Features
- NSIS installer
- Support for x64 and x86 architectures
- Custom installation directory option

### macOS Build Features
- DMG distribution
- Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Proper app categorization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App doesn't start**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
2. **Build fails**: Check that you have the required build tools for your platform
3. **Web app doesn't load**: Check your internet connection and verify the APP_URL is correct
4. **Icons not showing**: Ensure icon paths in your `.env` file point to existing files

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- Windows Defender might flag the app during first build. This is normal for unsigned applications.
- Consider code signing for production distribution.

#### macOS
- The app needs to be signed for distribution outside the Mac App Store.
- Users might need to allow the app in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.

## üîÑ Switching Between App Configurations

This boilerplate makes it easy to switch between the 5 pre-configured web applications. **Note**: This will overwrite your current `.env` file.

### Switch to WhatsApp Web
```powershell
copy configs\whatsappweb.env .env
npm start
```

### Switch to Discord Web App  
```powershell
copy configs\discord.env .env
npm start
```

### Switch to Notion
```powershell
copy configs\notion.env .env
npm start
```

### Switch to Asana
```powershell
copy configs\asana.env .env
npm start
```

### Switch to ChatGPT
```powershell
copy configs\chatgpt.env .env
npm start
```

After copying any configuration, you can:
1. **Test the configuration**: `node scripts/check-config.js`
2. **Run the app**: `npm start`
3. **Edit and Build for distribution\***: `npm run build:win` or `npm run build:mac`

\*The example apps that are included are not ready for distribution since they aren't signed applications.

Each configuration includes the proper app name, icon, URL, and optimized window settings for that specific application.
